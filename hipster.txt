There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses. (Bjarne Stroustrup) The best method for accelerating a computer is the one that boosts it by 9.8 m/s2. (Anonymous) We are Microsoft. Resistance Is Futile. You Will Be Assimilated. (Bumper sticker) Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter. (Eric Raymond) Deleted code is debugged code. (Jeff Sickel).If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. (Robert Sewell) The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) I think there’s a world market for about 5 computers. (Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of the Board, IBM, circa 1948) Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan) First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. (John Johnson)
Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave robbing and beneath managing. (Gerald Weinberg) Fifty years of programming language research, and we end up with C++? (Richard A. O’Keefe) Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris. (Larry Wall) The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry. (Henry Petroski)
